This repository contains the implementation of four types of linked lists in C++. Each list is implemented as a separate
menu-driven program. The programs include standard operations such as insertion, deletion, and display, with appropriate error handling and edge case management.

##ðŸ“‚ File Structure
Task 1 - singly_linked_list.cpp
Task 2 - doubly_linked_list.cpp
Task 3 - circular_singly_linked_list.cpp
Task 4 - circular_doubly_linked_list.cpp

##ðŸ§  Key Concepts Practiced
-Pointers and dynamic memory management
-Class-based modular design
-Edge case handling
-Traversal logic for linear and circular structures
-Bi-directional node navigation
